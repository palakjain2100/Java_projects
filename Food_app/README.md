<h1> Food Ordering App </h1></br>
<h2> This is a password protected food and drinks ordering app </h2></br>
<h3> We allow the user to create a login id and password.</br>

Following this if the user responds with yes we give them a list of items available to choose from.</br>
If the user says no we ask the user if they want to drink something</br>
