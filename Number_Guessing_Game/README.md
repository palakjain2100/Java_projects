<h1> Welcome to Number Guessing Game!
<h3> <p>We create a number guessing game in which a number in between 1-100 is generated by the system and the user has to guess the number</p>
<p> When the user guesses a number higher than the number generated the program returns "Try out a lower number"</p>
<p> When the user guesses a number lower than the number generated the program returns "Try out a higher number"</p>
<h2> Things added to optimize the program
	<h3> 1. Limiting the number of attempts
	<h3> 2. Making 2 rounds
	<h3> 3. Displaying score at the end
	<h3> 4. Giving points based on the number of attempts.
